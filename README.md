This is a simple extension used to display the implied probability whenever American odds appear on your webpage. The project is incredibly lightweight (about ~20 lines of code) and only scans for text after the page has loaded.

Here's an example of betting odds for a random NBA game:

Assuming the odds are "fair", the implied probability is the percentage chance that the bet is supposed to win. Because sportsbooks charge a fee or "vig" for placing bets, this number will appear slightly higher than the actual probability. This number is simpler way to look at sports betting: a "good bet" is one where you believe the percentage chance is higher than the implied probability.
